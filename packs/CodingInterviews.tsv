Coding Interviews	Binary Tree	Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List	https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-search-tree-to-sorted-doubly-linked-list/description/	Convert a **Binary Search Tree** to a sorted **Circular Doubly-Linked List** **in place**.<br><br>You can think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the predecessor and successor pointers in a doubly-linked list. For a circular doubly linked list, the predecessor of the first element is the last element, and the successor of the last element is the first element.<br><br>We want to do the transformation **in place**. After the transformation, the left pointer of the tree node should point to its predecessor, and the right pointer should point to its successor. You should return the pointer to the smallest element of the linked list.	O(n)	O(h)	We're expecting an optimized solution of:<br>Time Complexity: **O(n)**<br>Memory Complexity: **O(h)**	Inorder Traversal + Sorting	Breadth-First traversal + Queue	Recursive Inorder Traversal + Doubly Linked List	Recursive Depth-First Search + Doubly Linked List	D	The idea is to use a queue to keep track of the current level of nodes. We traverse the tree and update the pointers to create the DLL!<br><br>This approach has a time complexity of **O(n log(n))** due to sorting and a memory complexity of **O(n)** for storing the node values.	Due to the use of the queue, this approach would have a memory complexity of O(n), which **isn't quite optimal** here.	Highly inefficient.<br><br>The idea?  Perform recursive inorder traversal of the tree, creating the DLL as we go.  For each node, traverse its left subtree, append the node to the end of the linked list, and then traverse its right subtree.<br><br>This approach has a time complexity of **O(n^2)** for traversing the linked list each time a node is appended, with a memory complexity of **O(1)**.  However, **O(1)** memory complexity is achieved much more efficiently using **Morris traversal** (which was not listed among this set of answers)!	Correct...for this set of answers!<br><br>Here, the **recursion stack** has a maximum depth of the **height of the tree**, which is **O(h)** in memory.<br><br>We combine the left and right subtrees with the current node in the middle, forming the final DLL.<br><br>One could use a stack or queue to simulate the recursive call stack, but this would not improve the space or time complexity!<br><br>**Morris traversal** (not LISTED here!) is even better in terms of space complexity, but it is a little obscure for most people!	Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to get the nodes in sorted order, then create a circular DLL from the sorted nodes, like so:<br>1) Traverse the left subtree recursively and then visit the current node.<br>2) Store the previous node visited during the traversal in a variable.<br>3) Set the left pointer of the current node to the previous node.<br>4) If the previous node is not null, set its right pointer to the current node.<br>5) Set the current node as the previous node for the next iteration.<br>6) Traverse the right subtree recursively.<br>7) Once the traversal is complete, set the left pointer of the first node to the last node, and the right pointer of the last node to the first node to make it a circular DLL.<br>This approach has a time complexity of O(n) since it visits each node in the binary search tree exactly once, and a space complexity of O(n) for the recursive call stack.	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabogan/tentativeSolutions/main/CodingInterviewsPackSolutionsCPP/Convert%20Binary%20Search%20Tree%20to%20Sorted%20Doubly%20Linked%20List.cpp	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabogan/tentativeSolutions/main/CodingInterviewsPythonSolutions/Convert%20Binary%20Search%20Tree%20to%20Sorted%20Doubly%20Linked%20List.py	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabogan/tentativeSolutions/main/CodingInterviewsJavaSolutions/Convert%20Binary%20Search%20Tree%20to%20Sorted%20Doubly%20Linked%20List.java	https://youtu.be/Qx3xMofMhWw

O(n)	O(1)	We're expecting an optimized solution of:<br>Time Complexity: **O(n)**<br>Memory Complexity: **O(1)**	In-order Traversal + Stack	Morris Traversal	Breadth-first Traversal	Depth-first Traversal	B	**Suboptimal!**<br><br>This traverses the tree in O(n) time complexity and O(h) space complexity using a stack to keep track of visited nodes. Although it is a valid approach, it uses extra space and is not optimal when the tree is very large.	**Correct!**<br><br>**Morris Traversal** is a space-efficient method to traverse a binary tree without using a stack or recursion. The algorithm uses threading, which means it modifies the structure of the tree temporarily to reduce the space complexity of the traversal.<br><br>In short, use Morris Traversal to traverse the tree and check if the current node's value is less than the previous node's value.<br><br>Time Complexity: O(n) because you're traversing each node of the tree only once.<br>Space Complexity: O(1) because you're not using any extra space except for three pointers.	**Not quite.**<br><br>Although it works for traversing the entire tree, it does not efficiently identify the two swapped nodes and thus requires further processing. <br><br>Essentially, this approach traverses the tree in O(n) time complexity and O(n) space complexity using a queue to visit the nodes level by level.	Less efficient than other approaches.<br><br>Although a common approach for tree traversal, it does not allow us to identify the two swapped nodes without additional processing.<br><br>Traverses the tree in O(n) time and O(h) space using recursion or a stack.	Perform an in-order traversal of the tree and store the nodes in an array. Since in-order traversal of a BST returns the nodes in non-descending order, any two swapped nodes would appear in the array in an incorrect order. We can then identify the misplaced nodes by comparing each node with its next node in the array, and swap their values to recover the tree.<br><br>However, this requires O(n) space to store the nodes in the array, where n is the number of nodes in the tree - there are better approaches!	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabogan/tentativeSolutions/main/CodingInterviewsPackSolutionsCPP/Recover%20Binary%20Search%20Tree.cpp	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabogan/tentativeSolutions/main/CodingInterviewsPythonSolutions/Recover%20Binary%20Search%20Tree.py	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabogan/tentativeSolutions/main/CodingInterviewsJavaSolutions/Recover%20Binary%20Search%20Tree.java	https://youtu.be/vVjHJC8lkHo
Coding Interviews	Binary Tree	Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum	https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-maximum-path-sum/	A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them.

Not quite optimal!<br><br>BFS can also yield a time complexity of O(n), but needs additional space to store the maximum sum path for each level.	**Correct!**<br><br>Method: we take a recursive approach that traverses the tree, while calculating the maximum sum path passing through each node AND the maximum sum path starting from each node.<br><br>We use **Kadane's algorithm** to calculate the maximum sum path starting from each node, and combine it with the tree diameter problem to calculate the maximum sum path passing through each node.<br><br>Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.<br>Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.	Traverse every possible path in the binary tree and compute its path sum, keeping track of the maximum path sum seen so far.<br><br>The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because we potentially visit every node in the tree for every other node in the tree.

Each bucket contains a set of keys that share the same value. To support the three operations, the implementation updates the linked list and hash table accordingly, moving keys between buckets as necessary.	**Incorrect!**<br><br>One possible solution is to use a single hash table to store both the key-value pairs and the frequency count of each key. When a key is accessed, the frequency count is incremented and the hash table is scanned to find the key with the highest/lowest frequency count. <br><br>However, this approach would require scanning the entire hash table each time a key is accessed, making it inefficient for large datasets.	**Not quite!**<br><br>It's true that one could use a linked list to store the key-value pairs and the frequency count of each key.

When a key is accessed, its frequency count is incremented and the linked list is scanned to find the key with the highest/lowest frequency count.<br><br>However, this approach would require scanning the entire linked list each time a key is accessed - this makes it inefficient for large datasets.	**Suboptimal!**<br><br>It is possible to use two separate hash tables to store the key-value pairs and the frequency count of each key. When a key is accessed, the frequency count is incremented and the hash table with the frequency counts is scanned to find the key with the highest/lowest frequency count.<br><br>However, in the worst case, all keys could have the same hash code, and the hash table could end up having all keys collide in the same bucket, resulting in O(n) time complexity for accessing an element in the hash table - this is a rare case, and the hash table data structure has been designed to minimize collisions, but it can happen.	1) Initialize two hash tables (one to store string counts, the other to store string sets for each count).<br>2) *inc*: Add the key with count 1 if not already present; otherwise, increment its count.
