## Introduction

Our aim with this project is to help all software engineers (both aspiring and established) hone their problem-solving ability by helping them learn and explain approaches that answer questions commonly used in technical interviews.

## Features

The REST API offers the following features:

- **Authentication**: The API provides user authentication, allowing users to register, login, and manage their accounts securely.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can track their learning progress, including completed topics, exercises, or quizzes.
- **Stats and Insights**: The API generates comprehensive statistics and insights based on the user's learning activities. This includes identifying the user's weakest topics and strongest topics, helping them focus on areas that require improvement.
- **Topic Recommendations**: The API suggests relevant topics or learning materials based on the user's interests and learning history.
- **Flexible Topic Structure**: The API supports a flexible topic structure, allowing for hierarchical organization and categorization of learning content.
- **Interactive Exercises**: Users can access interactive exercises or quizzes related to each topic to reinforce their knowledge and understanding.
- **API Access**: The API provides endpoints to access user-specific data, such as progress, stats, completed exercises, and more.
- **Secure and Scalable**: The API follows industry-standard security practices, including data encryption, user authentication, and authorization. It is designed to be scalable, handling a large number of users and learning resources efficiently.

These features provide a robust learning experience for users, allowing them to track their progress, identify areas for improvement, and receive personalized recommendations.


## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have **.NET 7** installed on your machine. You can download it from the official .NET website: [Download .NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
3. Navigate to the project's root directory:  
`cd your-project`

4. **Important**: Make sure you have a `db.sqlite3` file in the root directory of the project. If not, create an empty SQLite database file named `db.sqlite3`.

5. Run the following command to restore the required NuGet packages:

```dotnet restore```

This command will download and install the necessary packages specified in the project's `config` file.

6. Once the packages are restored successfully, you can build and run the application using the following command:



## Usage

Explain how to use your REST API. Provide examples of common use cases, along with the corresponding request/response formats. Include any special considerations or requirements for interacting with your API.

## Endpoints

List and describe the available endpoints in your REST API. Include details such as the HTTP method, URL, request/response formats, and any required parameters or headers. Provide examples of how to use each endpoint.

## Authentication

If your REST API requires authentication or authorization, explain the authentication mechanism used (e.g., token-based, OAuth, etc.). Provide instructions on how to authenticate requests and access protected endpoints. Include any necessary API keys or access tokens.

## Error Handling

Explain how your REST API handles errors and communicates error responses. Describe the error response format, status codes, and any additional information provided in error responses. Provide examples of common error scenarios and how they are represented in the API responses.

## Testing

Describe how to test your REST API. Provide instructions on setting up test environments, running test suites, or interacting with the API in a testing context. Mention any testing frameworks or tools that are recommended for testing your API.

## Contributing

Explain how others can contribute to your project. Provide guidelines for bug reporting, feature requests, and submitting pull requests. Specify any coding conventions, development processes, or project structure guidelines that contributors should follow.

## License

Specify the license under which your REST API project is distributed. Include any licensing terms or restrictions that users or contributors should be aware of.
